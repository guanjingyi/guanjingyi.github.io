### About Jingyi (she/her)

I am an undergraduate student at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) studying Statistics, Psychology, and Computer Science. I am currently working on my Honors Thesis, "Topological Data Analysis of Knowledge Networks," to study how science evolves under the supervision of Profs. [Lori Ziegelmeier](https://www.loriziegelmeier.com/) and [Russell Funk](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/faculty/russell-funk).

### Research Interest

I aspire to develop novel statistical methods with machine learning and create new statistical, computational, and bioinformatics techniques to study complex diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders using high-dimensional data. Through the integration of high-throughput data and clinical information, I aim to uncover the genetic factors and biomarkers influencing patient survival and unravel the complex pathologies of these under-studied conditions. My research goal is to provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies, offering hope to patients facing limited treatment options.
