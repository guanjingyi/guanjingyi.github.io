Together with my teammate [Thu Dang](https://github.com/tdang244/), we learned from an article how to apply the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to prune for linkage disequilibrium. Then, we replicated their results in R using HapMap data to showcase the efficacy of HMM. We additionally conducted a comparison of outcomes employing both traditional GWAS methodology and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach for Type I Diabetes.
