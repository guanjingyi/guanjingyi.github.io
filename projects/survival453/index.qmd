In this [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eCuEElSWOMeu1W6ajiuUu4VBYNLnvmBX/view), we conducted a survival analysis to study how different risk factors affect adolescentsâ€™ age of first sex. After examining the Kaplan-Meier curves and Mantel-Cox log-rank tests on single covariates, the multivariate log-normal AFT regression model with interactions, and Cox PH model with and without time-varying covariates, we found that high depression scores, low household income,drinking alcohol without parents, and believing sex is part of an ideal romantic relationships are significant "risk" factors for early sexual debut across all analyses. In the end, we compared our results with previous studies and found consistencies and inconsistencies.
