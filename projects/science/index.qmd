My Honors Thesis, "Studying the Progress of Science: Topological Data Analysis of Knowledge Networks," is conducted with a peer under the supervision of Profs. [Lori Ziegelmeier](https://www.loriziegelmeier.com/) and [Russell Funk](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/faculty/russell-funk), applying topological data analysis techniques in the field of Science of Science to study how *science* evolves.

We constructed knowledge networks using Python and applied persistent homology to study knowledge gaps (cycles), further identifying and characterizing these gaps with the Open Applied Topology (OAT) software, created under the NSF-funded [ExHACT](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1854703&HistoricalAwards=false) project, to gain insights into the evolution of the knowledge network over time.

We formulated a typology of research papers based on their roles in the knowledge network, revealing that papers involved in knowledge gaps receive a higher number of citations.
