I am currently working on my Honors Thesis, “Topological Data Analysis of Knowledge Networks,” to study how science evolves under the supervision of Prof. Lori Ziegelmeier.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nResearch Interest\nI aspire to develop novel statistical methods with machine learning and create new statistical, computational, and bioinformatics techniques to study complex diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders using high-dimensional data. Through the integration of high-throughput data and clinical information, I aim to uncover the genetic factors and biomarkers influencing patient survival and unravel the complex pathologies of these under-studied conditions. My research goal is to provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies, offering hope to patients facing limited treatment options.\n\n\nEducation\nMacalester College | St. Paul, MN  B.A. in Statistics, Minors in Psychology and Computer Science | GPA: 4.0 | Sept 2020 - May 2024\n\n\nProgramming Skills\nLanguages: R, Java, Python, SQL, MATLAB\nUtilities: Rstudio, Anaconda, Git, Jupiter Notebook, Tableau\n\n\nSelected Coursework\nMathematics/Statistics: Mathematical Statistics, Statistical Genetics, Survival Analysis, Probability, Real Analysis (in progress), Topology, Computational Linear Algebra, Statistical Machine Learning, Introduction to Statistical Modeling\nComputer Science: Computational Geometry (in progress), Algorithm Design & Analysis, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming and Abstraction\nNeuroscience/Psychology: Behavioral Neuroscience, Introduction to Neuroscience, Neuroscience of Reward (planned), Educational Psychology, Introduction to Psychology\n\n\nResearch Experiences\n\nChildren’s Cancer Research Fund (CCRF) Researcher, 07/2023 - Present\n\nSupervised by Prof. Sunny Chan\nChan Lab, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota\n\nNSF-funded Undergraduate Researcher, 05/2023 - Present\n\nSupervised by Prof. Russell Funk, Prof. Lori Ziegelmeier, and Prof. Jason Owen-Smith.\n\nResearch Programmer, 07/2022 - 01/2023\n\nSupervised by Jaejin Lee, Principle Data Scientist, and Lingling Yang, Postdoc Associate\nNeuromodulation Research Center, Department of Neuroloogy, University of Minnesota\n\n\n\n\nSelected Talk and Poster Sessions\n\nJoint Mathematics Meeting, 01/2024\n\nTopological Data Analysis of Knowledge Networks\n\nAATRN Poster Session, 11/2023\n\nTopological Data Analysis of Knowledge Networks\n\nMAA-NCS, 09/2023\n\nTopological Data Analysis of Knowledge Networks\n\n\n\n\nIn-class Projects\n\nHidden Markov Model Application in Multiple Testing to Address Linkage Disequilibrium in Genome-Wide Association Study, 09/2022 - 12/2022\n\nSupervised by Prof. Kelsey Grinde\n\nA Survival Analysis of Sexual Debut Among Adolescents, 09/2022 - 12/2022\n\nSupervised by Prof. Vittorio Addona\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistantship\n\nMATH/STAT 455: Mathematical Statistics, Macalester College, 01/2024 - 05/2024 (Planned)\n\nInstructor: Prof. Taylor Okonek\n\nMATH/STAT 354: Probability, Macalester College, 09/2022 - 12/2022\n\nInstructor: Prof. Alicia Johnson\n\nCOMP 127: Object-Oriented Programming & Abstraction, Macalester College, 09/2021 - 5/2022\n\nInstructor: Prof. Joslenne Peña\n\n\n\n\nExtracurricular Activities\n\nCo-Chair, Student Advisory Board, 09/2023 - Present\nMember, Student Advisory Board, 09/2022 - Present\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, Macalester College\n\nDatabase Volunteer, 01/2022 - 05/2022\n\nInternational Institute of Minnesota\n\nData Analysis Volunteer, 02/2022 - 08/2022\n\nFoundations for Essential Needs\n\n\n\n\nContact\nEmail: jguan@macalester.edu\nPhone: +1 651-363-5786"
